TASK #1
1. Two of the team members are Assimilating, and one is Converging. The areas that are not represented are Accommodating and Diverging. The lacking area is definitely 'feeling'. One person is in far into the 'doing', one person is far into the 'reflecting', and the last person is towards the 'thinking'. There are not many learning styles clustered together. 

2. One good thing is no one is towards the 'feeling' category. It seems that we all like to work alone and don't necessarily learn from other people which is both good and bad. It's good because we are all independent and self sufficient, but it is bad because when we need to work together, we might not want to since we usually work alone. Another problem we may face is the fact that one person was scored heavily towards the doing side, and one towards the reflecting side. These two conflict heavily since they are opposites. 

3. We are not as diverse as we could have been. We are all towards the thinking category which is good. It could have been worse by having everyone spread out over the graph. The challenges we will face will be how to approach a specific problem. One or two people will want to learn by doing, and the other people will want to sit back and think for a while and not need to do anything. One solution we may think of is one person can do while the others reflect on what happened by watching. 


TASK #2
We are generally acting and deciding. 

Strengths:
We have very good problem solving skills and work quickly to accomplish tasks. We are also willing to take risks to get things done, which will also allow us to work quicker. 

Weaknesses:
We may work too fast and not solve a problem correctly, close an idea before we have finished talking thoroughly, and may struggle for leadership. Since we want to get things done, there is no time to establish leadership or planning.

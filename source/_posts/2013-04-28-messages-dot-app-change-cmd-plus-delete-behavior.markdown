One annoying thing in Mountain Lion's Messages.app application is that the shortcut `command + delete` is mapped to "Close Conversation" instead of deleting the current line of text. This fix to this is very simple. 

<!-- more -->
<br>
We are going to change the shortcut for the "Close Conversation..." action to something that's not `command + delete`. 

1. Choose **System Preferences** from the **Apple** menu.
2. Choose **Keyboard** from the View menu.
3. At the top, choose the **Keyboard Shortcuts** tab.
4. In the left box, click Application Shortcuts.
5. At the bottom of the right box, click the **+** sign.
6. Fill in the form as shown below in the image.
7. Click **Add**.
8. Done! Now when you go into messages, you'll have the usual `command + delete` behavior.

>Note: The keyboard shortcut given above is `shift + command + D`
